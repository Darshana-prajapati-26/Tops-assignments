 Q1 -
 Research and provide three real-world applications where C programming is extensively used, such as in embedded systems, operating systems, or game development. 


1. Operating Systems
__________________________
C language is mostly used to build operating systems like Linux, Windows, and Unix.

Many important parts of these systems, like file systems and device drivers, are written in C.

C is fast and allows the programmer to control hardware directly, which is useful for system software.

Some popular programs like MySQL (used for databases) and Apache/Nginx (used for websites) are also written in C.

2. Embedded Systems
_______________________
Embedded systems are small computers inside machines like washing machines, cars, microwaves, and smart TVs.

These systems use C because it is lightweight and works well with hardware.

C is used in many devices such as IoT devices, remote controls, medical machines, and traffic lights.

Platforms like Arduino, which are used for making electronics projects, use C language.

3. Game Development
______________________
C is also used in creating computer and video games, especially those that need high speed and performance.

Classic games like Doom were made using C.

C is used to build game engines and graphics libraries, which are the tools needed to make games work.

It helps make games that respond quickly and run smoothly.
